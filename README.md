# Adopt A Pet - CFLMS CodeReview 11 MarinBalabanov

## Project description

__Please find a video of the project here: https://youtu.be/Ig9F8vZOXuY__

This is a pet database with a web frontend in Bootstrap, JQuery, PHP and MySQL. All pets have a photo and live at a specific location. They also a description, age and belong to a breed.

All animals show their name, an image, a description and a location. A location should hold information about the city, ZIP-code, address. Senior animals (older than 8 years old) have their age emphasized.

The pet list page has a __live search__ allowing users to  filter/search through the pets (this feature uses AJAX).

- __superadmin:__ This type of user has unrestricted rights. They can access the list of pets and search/filter through it, can create new pet entries, add new locations or change existing ones and they can create new users or change existing users.

### Views of Pet List
This is the main list of Adopt A Pet. __Left screenshot:__ Users can see all pets listed. They can filter by name using the live search. __Middle screenshot:__ Admins and Superadmin see a variation of the pet list page. They can not only filter by name using the live search but can also add new pet entries as well as change or delete existing ones. __Right screenshot:__ When an Admin or Superadmin clicks on "New Pet Entry" the accordion opens up to present them with the form to create a new pet entry.

### Views of Location and User Administration
__Left screenshot:__ Admins and Superadmins can see a list of all locations, edit existing ones or add new locations to the list. Locations cannot be deleted, because they are used as a foreign key in the pets table. This is not much of an issue, because admins can change existing locations or assign pets to different locations.
__Right screenshot:__ And finally, only Superadmins can edit or delete existing users.
