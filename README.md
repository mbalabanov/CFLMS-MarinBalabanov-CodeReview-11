## Project description: “Adopt a Pet”

You love animals and think it is time to adopt one. You like all sorts of animals: small animals, large animals, you may even like reptiles and birds and may be open to adopting animals of any age. 

All animals have a photo and live at a specific location. They also have a description, age and belong to a breed. Small animals may even have their own website. 

What all the animals have in common is a name, an image, a description and a location. A location should hold information about the city, ZIP-code, address (single line like “Praterstrasse 23”).

- Small animals have a location, an image, a name, a description, hobbies and age.
- Large animals have a location, an image, a name, a description, hobbies and age.
- Senior animals (older than 8 years old) have a location, an image, a name, a description, hobbies and age.

For the regular points of this CodeReview, you need to create a structure using PHP and MySQL that will display the relevant data of the small, large and senior animals.
