# Adopt A Pet - CFLMS CodeReview 11 MarinBalabanov

## Project description

__Please find a video of the project here: https://youtu.be/Ig9F8vZOXuY__

This is a pet database with a web frontend in Bootstrap, JQuery, PHP and MySQL. All pets have a photo and live at a specific location. They also a description, age and belong to a breed.

All animals show their name, an image, a description and a location. A location should hold information about the city, ZIP-code, address. Senior animals (older than 8 years old) have their age emphasized.

The pet list page has a __live search__ allowing users to  filter/search through the pets (this feature uses AJAX).

## User Types
By default, there are three kinds of users:
- __User:__ Can access the list of pets and search/filter through it. This type of user _cannot_ create new pet entries, add new locations and create new users or change existing ones. 
- __admin:__ Can access the list of pets and search/filter through it and can create new pet entries as well as add new locations or change existing ones. This type of user _cannot_ create new users or change existing users.
- __superadmin:__ This type of user has unrestricted rights. They can access the list of pets and search/filter through it, can create new pet entries, add new locations or change existing ones and they can create new users or change existing users.
