## Project description

__Please find a video of the project here: https://youtu.be/Ig9F8vZOXuY__

This is a pet database with a web frontend in Bootstrap, JQuery, PHP and MySQL. All pets have a photo and live at a specific location. They also a description, age and belong to a breed.

All animals show their name, an image, a description and a location. A location should hold information about the city, ZIP-code, address. Senior animals (older than 8 years old) have their age emphasized.

The pet list page has a __live search__ allowing users to  filter/search through the pets (this feature uses AJAX).
